<h1>Important Note:</h1>

This website stores all data in local storage. Once the challenge starts, do not clear your browser data, as this will delete all progress. Additionally, use the same browser to track your progress. If you use a different browser, it will create a new challenge, just like starting from scratch.<hr>

<h3>I created the 45-day challenge for the following reasons:</h3>

`1. Goal Setting and Achievement:` Encourages participants to set clear, achievable goals and work towards them consistently over 45 days.

`2. Building Positive Habits: `Helps in developing new, positive habits or breaking old, negative ones through daily practice and repetition.

`3. Self-Discipline:` Enhances self-discipline by requiring participants to commit to daily activities or routines.

`4. Manifestation:` Utilizes the concept of manifestation, where participants focus on positive thinking and visualization techniques to attract their desired outcomes.

These elements together make the 45-day challenge a powerful tool for personal growth and transformation.<hr>

<h3>How the 45-Day Challenge Website Works:</h3>

`1. Strict 45-Day Challenge:` 
   - Participants must commit to a strict 45-day challenge. If any dayâ€™s tasks are not completed, the challenge will reset to day 1.
   - This strict approach is designed to build discipline and encourage the formation of good habits.

`2. Task Entry:`
   - Participants enter the tasks they want to complete during the 45-day challenge at the beginning.
   - Users have the flexibility to add new tasks or delete existing ones at any point during the challenge.

`3. Task Completion:`
   - To complete a task, users simply click on it.
   - Upon completion, the website will display a motivational message for inspiration.
   - A streak counter will show the number of consecutive days tasks have been completed.

`4. Daily Reset:`
   - If a participant fails to complete even a single task on any given day, the challenge will reset to day 1 the following day.
   - If all tasks are completed for the day, the next day will start at midnight. At midnight, all task completions for that day will be unchecked, allowing participants to start fresh for the new day.
